          <div class="span4 collapse-group">
            <p class="text-muted">I kickstarted my career in Programming by moving to Manchester for 3 months and starting off as a Software Development
              and Testing Trainee. I completed the challenging training provided by QA Consulting and became specialised
              in both the development and testing side of software.
              <a class="collapse text-muted" id="viewdetails2"><br><br>The training taught me about a collection of domains, ranging from MySQL and H2 within DBMS, to back-end technologies like Java, to front-end technologies such as JavaScript and HTML. Being a strategic thinker with a logical mindset helped me code accurately and efficiently, as well as to think outside the box while testing the quality of software i.e. its functionality, usability and accessibility.
              <br><br>Since then, I have moved to Brighton to join NETBuilder as an IT Consultant – Software Test Analyst. The first day itself brought great news that we would be working on a project with one of their clients – BT!
              <br><br>I am now on-site at BT's office in London, on a contract basis. We are currently working in large groups where each of us have a major responsibility. This is hugely exciting for me as not only is this a prominent company but being the Tester of the group means I can greatly improve my own skills as well as, in a small way, guarantee the satisfaction of BT customers.

              over a period of 6 months or so, I put in hard work consistently to reach my goal at the time: increasing muscle
              mass.
              <a class="collapse text-muted" id="viewdetails6"><br><br>During this time I realised that gym training helped me balance my daily routine i.e. work-life, sleep
              and diet. I had to sacrifice gym in my final year to ensure I focused all my physical and mental energy into
              my education. Succeeding in that, I have now returned, motivated and ready with a new goal: to become a more
              toned, leaner version of my current self and to follow a low-carb diet!

          <div class="span4 collapse-group">
            <p class="text-muted">I have been a huge Manchester United fan since I moved to the UK. I was lucky to have had a childhood watching
              football in the era of the ruthless three: Ronaldo, Rooney and Tevez. We had gone onto win the
              Premier League, as well as the famous Champions League in the 2007/2008 season! One of my biggest dreams as a child was to watch a
              football match live at the stadium.
              <a class="collapse text-muted" id="viewdetails4"><br><br>First Match: During my time in Barca, my best friend, Vashi and I went to Camp Nou to watch 2 matches. The first
            was Barca vs. Eibar. We got to experience first-hand, the greatness of Messi and Neymar, alongside
            the amazing atmosphere in the stadium. Barca won 4-2!
            <br><br>Second Match: The second game we watched was the friendly Barca Legends Vs. Man United Legends.
            This marked a special day in my life as I got to witness the unimaginably talented Ronaldinho!
            <br><br>Third Match: On the 6th October 2018, we went to see a match where United played Newcastle at
            home. There was so much pressure on the United players before the game as they had lost the
            previous games, and this was a must-win game to keep up with the other title contenders. And I
            must say, it was probably the best United game of the season! We were 2-0 down at the break, but
            went on to win 3-2 in the last 20 minutes of the game! It fascinated me to see how true the loyalty
            of United fans really was as they supported through the downfalls too. Old Trafford really is The
            Theatre of Dreams, now more than ever.
            <br><br>I regularly meet up with friends to play football. I am left-footed, fast, and prefer playing on the right
            wing. I love making long runs through the right channel, making long balls, and belting it straight into
            the goal. Alongside football, I greatly involve myself in many other sports; fitness training, cycling,
            running and more.

            <p class="text-muted">After moving to London from Norway, the first city I moved to independently was Coventry. The city being 2 hours
              away from home meant I had to move away from my family for the first time. During those 3 years, I really
              got to know and enjoy the city. This made me realise that there are hundreds of thousand cities in this world,
              each with many hidden gems to discover!
              <span class="collapse text-muted" id="viewdetails7"><br><br>Travelling to Barcelona for my placement year was the perfect opportunity
            to really explore the city with Vashi and live like both a local and a tourist over nine months.

              travelled to different cities for work purposes, such as Manchester and Brighton.
              <br><br>Travelling to various countries with the intention of understanding different cultures and appreciating
              their lifestyle has become a hobby and long-term goal of mine. The one country I would love to visit is Malaysia

                      help with my progression. I didn't have enough work experience, so I was actively looking for a placement
                      opportunity. After many applications, I finally secured a job with TEFL Trainer, as an English
                      teacher.
                      <span class="collapse text-muted" id="viewdetails5"><br><br>I taught students with different levels of English, which ranged from absolute beginners
                      to the most advanced level (almost native). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinukshen/" target="_blank">See my LinkedIn page for an in-depth overview of my time TEFL Trainer</a>.
                    <br><br>Barcelona should be appreciated for it's hidden beauty. It's not a country you can explore in a few days. I made the most out of it with Vashi, who worked for TEFL Trainer as well. Besides the popular places in Barcelona, we asked our students for local places that we could also check out.
                    <br><br>One of our favourite places was Bunkers – El Carmel. It's a mountain with the perfect height to see the whole of Barcelona in detail. We visited this places over 10 times and it was easily accessibile by bus, which was a bonus! We used to visit this place at around 9:30pm to catch the sunset. The view was breathtaking. We also caught the sunrise at Barceloneta Beach, which was sensational.
                    <br><br>After living amongst the Spaniards, I noticed how the UK lifestyle is different to theirs. They are generally more relaxed and don't tend to stress over work as much. It's common for them to constantly change jobs and according to my students, there are many French and Italians who have come to Spain to work.
                    <br><br>To put it in a nutshell, this was a very special year for me!

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Final Year Dissertation At Coventry University</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/01-full.jpg" alt=" ">
                <p>Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a non-intrusive, optimising method used within both the automotive and
                  aerodynamic industries, to adapt the body of the vehicle such that there is minimal drag force opposing
                  it. The aim is to acquire the local velocity distribution in a flow of air or transparent liquid past an
                  object, by evaluating instantaneous images of the flow structures. </p>

                <p>In the duration of my project, I widened my knowledge on the basic theory of PIV and learnt how this technique
                  can be applied to the real world. To begin my exploration on the practical side of this matter, I reviewed
                  the PIV methodology to understand the various approaches, requirements and limitations. Alongside this,
                  I studied and analysed two PIV software and found PIVlab to be most advantageous of the two, in evaluating
                  the images. Subsequently, I carried out a numerical and physical experiment to apply what I had learnt.</p>

                <p>In the numerical experiment, I formed a basic code in MATLAB to create artificial PIV-images, and another
                  script to collect data from these images so that I could estimate the resulting velocity field. The existing
                  PIV software which included evaluation techniques such as cross-correlation and Fast Fourier Transform
                  based cross-correlation (FFT-CC), enabled me to develop my own code with the simpler ‘centre of mass’ approach.</p>

                <p>In the physical experiment, my supervisor and I built a simple desktop experiment where we imitated the actual
                  PIV setup, which resulted in the desired flow structures being successfully achieved. I had previously
                  reviewed a few papers on these types of experiments, so that I was able to manipulate the most reasonable
                  apparatus, whilst adhering to the other requirements of my investigation. Images of the flow were taken
                  and analysed using PIVlab. By comparing these results to a paper where similar experiments were carried
                  out, I was able to understand how different set-ups, cause differences in results.</p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto " src="img/portfolio/02-full.jpg " alt=" ">
                <p>Took on a group project, where knowledge on classical mechanics was fundamental. However, I was the only
                  one who had studied mechanics in the previous year (as it was an elective module). Our task was to convince
                  the audience that bungee jumping off the Clifton suspension bridge is a safe sport. I helped each of the
                  members understand the theory behind bungee jumping by recapping on the maths behind this activity, and
                  explained it thoroughly to the team. I learned how to put together a Simulink model from one team member,
                  which we then used to prove that the sport was safe. This reflected my responsibility skills, teamwork
                  skills and the ability to build strong relationships while working together as a group. Combining time
                  management with all these skills, I was able to develop my project management skills and lead my team members
                  into delivering a confident presentation. </p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto " src="img/portfolio/03-full.jpg " alt=" ">
                <p>I worked within a team of four to solve a problem, where we had to estimate the energy required to call the
                  lift in Coventry University's Engineering and Computing building from the second floor to the ground floor
                  and then to transport a 100kg individual to the 3rd floor. Due to my strength in mechanics, I was able
                  to evaluate the theory of this task as it was purely based on 'conservation of energy'. As a team leader,
                  I remained calm and explained the theory and how to execute this problem practically to the entire team.
                  We estimated the height of the building from the lower to the upper ground by counting the number of stairs
                  and multiplying the height of one stair in metres. We managed to estimate the energy from finding the distance
                  of the whole building, the force required for the cable to pull the lift upwards and the force of gravity
                  due to the weight of the lift and the 100kg individual. From this project, I learnt how to explain the
                  method to solve the problem in a good manner and made sure the whole team contributed equally. If I were
                  to complete the project again I would prepare a PowerPoint presentation to explain the problem to my team
                  in depth and also find the blue print of the building to get a more precise value of the height for a better
                  result of the energy required for the lift.</p>
