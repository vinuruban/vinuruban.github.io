          <div class="span4 collapse-group">
            <p class="text-muted">I kickstarted my career in Programming by moving to Manchester for 3 months and starting off as a Software Development
              and Testing Trainee. I completed the challenging training provided by QA Consulting and became specialised
              in both the development and testing side of software.
              <a class="collapse text-muted" id="viewdetails2"><br><br>The training taught me about a collection of domains, ranging from MySQL and H2 within DBMS, to back-end technologies like Java, to front-end technologies such as JavaScript and HTML. Being a strategic thinker with a logical approach helped me to code accurately and efficiently, as well as to think outside the box while testing the quality of software i.e. its functionality, usability and accessibility.
              <br><br>I have since moved to Brighton to join NETBuilder as an IT Consultant – Software Test Analyst. The first day itself brought great news that we will be working on a project with one of their clients in Jan 2019 – BT!
              <br><br>I will be a Test Analyst at BT in London, on a contract basis. We will be working in groups of 3 where each of us have a major responsibility: Front-end developer, back-end developer, and tester. This is hugely exciting for me as not only is this a prominent company but being the Tester of the group means I can greatly improve my own skills as well as, in a small way, guarantee the satisfaction of BT customers.

            <p class="text-muted">Music has been a huge part of my life culturally. From the young age of 10, I started learning the keyboard and
              by 16, was ready to share my wisdom. My favourite musician is <a href="https://twitter.com/thisisysr" target="_blank">Yuvan Shankar Raja</a>.
              His music inspired my cousin and I to recompose many songs as covers, which can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq8-DCYIyfIk33w7VZIAhxQ"

              used Windows Movie Maker for our first music video. Currently, we use Sony Vegas Pro 13 for professional quality
              productions.
            <br><br>Ideally, we would like to develop this project into a potentially successful venture in the future

            have been possibile without hard-work, determination and consistency. I realised that gym training has helped
            me balance my daily routine, such as work-life, sleep and diet. I would say hitting the gym has become an addiction

            <p class="text-muted">I am a huge Manchester United fan since moving to the UK. I witnessed one of the best team during 2007/08. The
              squud consisting of a ruthless front three – Ronaldo, Rooney and Tevez. We went on to win the Premier League,
              as well as the famous Champions League.
              <a class="collapse text-muted" id="viewdetails4"><br><br>It had always been a dream to visit Old Trafford and feel the atmosphere. This was virtually impossible as I lived in far away from the home ground. However, the time came when I moved to Manchester for 3-months training with QA Consulting. 
            <br><br>On the 6<sup>th</sup> October 2018, I went to see a match where United played Newcaste at home. The was pressure before the game as United had lost the previous games, and this was a must-win game to keep up with the other title contenders. And I must say, it was probably the best United game of the season! We were 2-0 down at the break, but went on to win 3-2 in the last 20 minutes of the game! What fascinated me more was the fact that the fans were still supporting the team even when we were loosing. It's hard to find such faithful fans and the atmosphere elsewhere! I would recommend you to visit The Theatre of Dreams.
            <br><br>I regularly meet up with friends to play football. I am left-footed, fast, and prefer playing on the right wing. I love making long runs though the right channel, making long balls, and belting it straight into the goal. Alongside football, I greatly involve myself in many other sports; fitness
            training, cycling, running and more. 
            <br><br>I successfully train and manage a weekend football team for my neighbourhood
            children where sportsmanship is more of a requisite than skill. This experience has greatly improved my communication,
            and has given me the opportunity to motivate others.

                    <p class="text-muted">After doing well in the first two years at my university, I realised it's not just education that would
                      help with my progression. I didn't have enough work experience, so I was actively looking for a placement
                      opportunity. After many applications, I finally got accepted a position with TEFL Trainer, as an English
                      teacher.
                      <span class="collapse text-muted" id="viewdetails5"><br><br>I taught students with different levels of English, which ranged from absolute beginners
                      to the most advanced level (almost native). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinukshen/" target="_blank">See my LinkedIn page to learn more about my work experience</a>. 
                    <br><br>I personally believe Barcelona should be appreciated for their unnoticeable places. It's not a country you can explore in a few days. I made the most out of it with my coursework who worked for TEFL Trainer as well. As well as visiting the popular places in Barcelona, we asked our students for noteless places to see.
                    <br><br>The best place I visited was Bunkers – El Carmel. It's a mountain with the perfect height to see the whole of Barcelona in detail. I've visited this places around 10 times and the best part about this is that there are buses that takes you right to the top. I used to visit this place around 9:30pm to catch the sunset.
                    <br><br>After living amongst the Spaniards, I noticed how the UK lifestyle is different to theirs. They are generally more relaxed and not many stress over work. It's common for them to constantly change jobs and according to my students, there are many French and Italians who have come their to work.
                    <br><br>To put it in a nutshell, this was a very special year for me!

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Final Year Dissertation At Coventry University</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/01-full.jpg" alt=" ">
                <p>Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a non-intrusive, optimising method used within both the automotive and
                  aerodynamic industries, to adapt the body of the vehicle such that there is minimal drag force opposing
                  it. The aim is to acquire the local velocity distribution in a flow of air or transparent liquid past an
                  object, by evaluating instantaneous images of the flow structures. </p>

                <p>In the duration of my project, I widened my knowledge on the basic theory of PIV and learnt how this technique
                  can be applied to the real world. To begin my exploration on the practical side of this matter, I reviewed
                  the PIV methodology to understand the various approaches, requirements and limitations. Alongside this,
                  I studied and analysed two PIV software and found PIVlab to be most advantageous of the two, in evaluating
                  the images. Subsequently, I carried out a numerical and physical experiment to apply what I had learnt.</p>

                <p>In the numerical experiment, I formed a basic code in MATLAB to create artificial PIV-images, and another
                  script to collect data from these images so that I could estimate the resulting velocity field. The existing
                  PIV software which included evaluation techniques such as cross-correlation and Fast Fourier Transform
                  based cross-correlation (FFT-CC), enabled me to develop my own code with the simpler ‘centre of mass’ approach.</p>

                <p>In the physical experiment, my supervisor and I built a simple desktop experiment where we imitated the actual
                  PIV setup, which resulted in the desired flow structures being successfully achieved. I had previously
                  reviewed a few papers on these types of experiments, so that I was able to manipulate the most reasonable
                  apparatus, whilst adhering to the other requirements of my investigation. Images of the flow were taken
                  and analysed using PIVlab. By comparing these results to a paper where similar experiments were carried
                  out, I was able to understand how different set-ups, cause differences in results.</p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto " src="img/portfolio/02-full.jpg " alt=" ">
                <p>Took on a group project, where knowledge on classical mechanics was fundamental. However, I was the only
                  one who had studied mechanics in the previous year (as it was an elective module). Our task was to convince
                  the audience that bungee jumping off the Clifton suspension bridge is a safe sport. I helped each of the
                  members understand the theory behind bungee jumping by recapping on the maths behind this activity, and
                  explained it thoroughly to the team. I learned how to put together a Simulink model from one team member,
                  which we then used to prove that the sport was safe. This reflected my responsibility skills, teamwork
                  skills and the ability to build strong relationships while working together as a group. Combining time
                  management with all these skills, I was able to develop my project management skills and lead my team members
                  into delivering a confident presentation. </p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted ">Energy required for the lift in Coventry University's Engineering and Computing building</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto " src="img/portfolio/03-full.jpg " alt=" ">
                <p>I worked within a team of four to solve a problem, where we had to estimate the energy required to call the
                  lift in Coventry University's Engineering and Computing building from the second floor to the ground floor
                  and then to transport a 100kg individual to the 3rd floor. Due to my strength in mechanics, I was able
                  to evaluate the theory of this task as it was purely based on 'conservation of energy'. As a team leader,
                  I remained calm and explained the theory and how to execute this problem practically to the entire team.
                  We estimated the height of the building from the lower to the upper ground by counting the number of stairs
                  and multiplying the height of one stair in metres. We managed to estimate the energy from finding the distance
                  of the whole building, the force required for the cable to pull the lift upwards and the force of gravity
                  due to the weight of the lift and the 100kg individual. From this project, I learnt how to explain the
                  method to solve the problem in a good manner and made sure the whole team contributed equally. If I were
                  to complete the project again I would prepare a PowerPoint presentation to explain the problem to my team
                  in depth and also find the blue print of the building to get a more precise value of the height for a better
                  result of the energy required for the lift.</p>
