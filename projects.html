			<p>Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a non-intrusive, optimising method used within both the automotive and aerodynamic industries, to adapt the body of the vehicle such that there is minimal drag force opposing it. The aim is to acquire the local velocity distribution in a flow of air or transparent liquid past an object, by evaluating instantaneous images of the flow structures...
